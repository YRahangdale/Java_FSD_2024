Basic Java Interview Questions
Q1. Explain JDK, JRE and JVM?
JDK vs JRE vs JVM
JDK	JRE	JVM
It stands for Java Development Kit.	It stands for Java Runtime Environment.	It stands for Java Virtual Machine.
It is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs.	JRE refers to a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.	It is an abstract machine. 
It is a specification that provides a run-time environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
It contains JRE + development tools.	
It’s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists.	JVM follows three notations: Specification, Implementation, and Runtime Instance.

Q2. Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java.
main() in Java is the entry point for any Java program. It is always written as public static void main(String[] args).

public: Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.
static: It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class-based. main() is made static in Java so that it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class. In case, main is not made static then the compiler will throw an error as main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made and only static methods can be directly invoked via the class. 
void: It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value.
main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occurs.
String args[]: It is the parameter passed to the main method.

Q3. Why Java is platform independent?
Java is called platform independent because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.


Q4. Why Java is not 100% Object-oriented?

Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive data types such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.

Q5. What are wrapper classes in Java?

Wrapper classes convert the Java primitives into the reference types (objects). Every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it. These are known as wrapper classes because they “wrap” the primitive data type into an object of that class. Refer to the below image which displays different primitive type, wrapper class and constructor argument.


Q6. What are constructors in Java?
In Java, constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and it is automatically called when an object is created.

There are two types of constructors:

Default Constructor: In Java, a default constructor is the one which does not take any inputs. In other words, default constructors are the no argument constructors which will be created by default in case you no other constructor is defined by the user. Its main purpose is to initialize the instance variables with the default values. Also, it is majorly used for object creation. 
Parameterized Constructor: The parameterized constructor in Java, is the constructor which is capable of initializing the instance variables with the provided values. In other words, the constructors which take the arguments are called parameterized constructors.

Q7. What is singleton class in Java and how can we make a class singleton?
Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

Q8. What is the difference between Array list and vector in Java?
ArrayList	Vector
Array List is not synchronized.	 Vector is synchronized.
Array List is fast as it’s non-synchronized.	Vector is slow as it is thread safe.
If an element is inserted into the Array List, it increases its Array size by 50%.	Vector defaults to doubling size of its array.
Array List does not define the increment size.	Vector defines the increment size.
Array List can only use Iterator for traversing an Array List.	Vector can use both Enumeration and Iterator for traversing.

Q9. What is the difference between equals() and == in Java?
Equals() method is defined in Object class in Java and used for checking equality of two objects defined by business logic.

“==” or equality operator in Java is a binary operator provided by Java programming language and used to compare primitives and objects. public boolean equals(Object o) is the method provided by the Object class. The default implementation uses == operator to compare two objects. For example: method can be overridden like String class. equals() method is used to compare the values of two objects.

Q10. What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?
The major difference between Heap and Stack memory are:

Features	Stack	Heap
Memory	Stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.	Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application.
Access	Stack memory can’t be accessed by other threads.	Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible.
Memory Management	Follows LIFO manner to free memory.	Memory management is based on the generation associated with each object.
Lifetime	Exists until the end of execution of the thread.	Heap memory lives from the start till the end of application execution.
Usage	Stack memory only contains local primitive and reference variables to objects in heap space.	Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space.

Q11. What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.
Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:

Packages help in avoiding name clashes
They provide easier access control on the code
Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package
Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes

Q12. Why pointers are not used in Java?
Java doesn’t use pointers because they are unsafe and increases the complexity of the program. Since, Java is known for its simplicity of code, adding the concept of pointers will be contradicting. Moreover, since JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order to avoid direct access to memory by the user,  pointers are discouraged in Java.

Q13. What is JIT compiler in Java?
JIT stands for Just-In-Time compiler in Java. It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it. This is why it is often responsible for the performance optimization of Java applications at the run time.

Q14. What are access modifiers in Java?
In Java, access modifiers are special keywords which are used to restrict the access of a class, constructor, data member and method in another class. Java supports four types of access modifiers:

Default
Private
Protected
Public
Modifier	Default	Private	Protected	Public
Same class	YES	YES	YES	YES
Same Package subclass	YES	NO	YES	YES
Same Package non-subclass	YES	NO	YES	YES
Different package subclass	NO	NO	YES	YES
Different package non-subclass	NO	NO	NO	YES
Q15. Define a Java Class.
A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object. Let’s have a look at the syntax of a class.

class Abc {
member variables // class body
methods}
Q16. What is an object in Java and how is it created?
An object is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior. An object has three characteristics:

State
Behavior
Identity
An object is created using the ‘new’ keyword. For example:

ClassName obj = new ClassName();

Q17. What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming or popularly known as OOPs is a programming model or approach where the programs are organized around objects rather than logic and functions. In other words, OOP mainly focuses on the objects that are required to be manipulated instead of logic. This approach is ideal for the programs large and complex codes and needs to be actively updated or maintained.

Q18. What are the main concepts of OOPs in Java?
Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs is a programming style that is associated with concepts like:

Inheritance: Inheritance is a process where one class acquires the properties of another.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping up the data and code together as a single unit.
Abstraction: Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation details from the user and only providing the functionality to the users. 
Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take multiple forms.
Q19. What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
In Java, a local variable is typically used inside a method, constructor, or a block and has only local scope. Thus, this variable can be used only within the scope of a block. The best benefit of having a local variable is that other methods in the class won’t be even aware of that variable.

Example

if(x > 100)
{
String test = "Edureka";
}
 

Whereas, an instance variable in Java, is a variable which is bounded to its object itself. These variables are declared within a class, but outside a method. Every object of that class will create it’s own copy of the variable while using it. Thus, any changes made to the variable won’t reflect in any other instances of that class and will be bound to that particular instance only.

class Test{
public String EmpName;
public int empAge;
}
Q20. Differentiate between the constructors and methods in Java?
Methods	Constructors
1. Used to represent the behavior of an object	1. Used to initialize the state of an object
2. Must have a return type	2. Do not have any return type
3. Needs to be invoked explicitly	3. Is invoked implicitly
4. No default method is provided by the compiler	4. A default constructor is provided by the compiler if the class has none
5. Method name may or may not be same as class name	5. Constructor name must always be the same as the class name
Q21. What is final keyword in Java?
final is a special keyword in Java that is used as a non-access modifier. A final variable can be used in different contexts such as:

final variable
When the final keyword is used with a variable then its value can’t be changed once assigned. In case the no value has been assigned to the final variable then using only the class constructor a value can be assigned to it.

final method
When a method is declared final then it can’t be overridden by the inheriting class.

final class
When a class is declared as final in Java, it can’t be extended by any subclass class but it can extend other class.

Q22. What is the difference between break and continue statements?
break	continue
1. Can be used in switch and loop (for, while, do while) statements	1. Can be only used with loop statements
2. It causes the switch or loop statements to terminate the moment it is executed	2. It doesn’t terminate the loop but causes the loop to jump to the next iteration
3. It terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch immediately	3. A continue within a loop nested with a switch will cause the next loop iteration to execute
Example break:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if (i == 3)
{
break;
}
System.out.println(i);
}
Example continue:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
if(i == 2)
{
continue;
}
System.out.println(i);
}
Q23.What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.
An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

For example:


public class InfiniteForLoopDemo
{
public static void main(String[] arg) {
for(;;)
System.out.println("Welcome to Edureka!");
// To terminate this program press ctrl + c in the console.
}
}
 

Q24. What is the difference between this() and super() in Java?
In Java, super() and this(), both are special keywords that are used to call the constructor. 

this()	super()
1. this() represents the current instance of a class	1. super() represents the current instance of a parent/base class
2. Used to call the default constructor of the same class	2. Used to call the default constructor of the parent/base class
3. Used to access methods of the current class	3. Used to access methods of the base class
4.  Used for pointing the current class instance	4. Used for pointing the superclass instance
5. Must be the first line of a block	5. Must be the first line of a block
Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.

Q26. Differentiate between static and non-static methods in Java.
Static Method	Non-Static Method
1. The static keyword must be used before the method name	1. No need to use the static keyword before the method name
2. It is called using the class (className.methodName) 	2. It is can be called like any general method
3. They can’t access any non-static instance variables or methods	3. It can access any static method and any static variable without creating an instance of the class
Q27. What is constructor chaining in Java?
In Java, constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another with respect to the current object. Constructor chaining is possible only through legacy where a subclass constructor is responsible for invoking the superclass’ constructor first. There could be any number of classes in the constructor chain. Constructor chaining can be achieved in two ways:

Within the same class using this()
From base class using super()
Q28. Difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer.

Factor	String	StringBuilder	StringBuffer
Storage Area	Constant String Pool	Heap Area	Heap Area
Mutability	Immutable	Mutable	Mutable
Thread Safety	Yes	No	Yes
Performance	Fast	More efficient	Less efficient
Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. Java provides three built-in classloaders:

Bootstrap ClassLoader
Extension ClassLoader
System/Application ClassLoader
Q30. Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?
In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool. Since String literals are usually shared between multiple clients, action from one client might affect the rest. It enhances security, caching, synchronization, and performance of the application. 

Q31. What is the difference between an array and an array list?
Array	ArrayList
Cannot contain values of different data types	Can contain values of different data types.
Size must be defined at the time of declaration	Size can be dynamically changed
Need to specify the index in order to add data	No need to specify the index
Arrays are not type parameterized	Arraylists are type 
Arrays can contain primitive data types as well as objects	Arraylists can contain only objects, no primitive data types are allowed
Q32. What is a Map in Java?
In Java, Map is an interface of Util package which maps unique keys to values. The Map interface is not a subset of the main Collection interface and thus it behaves little different from the other collection types. Below are a few of the characteristics of Map interface: 

Map doesn’t contain duplicate keys.
Each key can map at max one value.

Q33. What is collection class in Java? List down its methods and interfaces.
In Java, the collection is a framework that acts as an architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. Using Collections you can perform various tasks like searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, deletion, etc. Java collection framework includes the following:

Interfaces
Classes
Methods
The below image shows the complete hierarchy of the Java Collection.

In case you are facing any challenges with these java interview questions, please comment on your problems in the section below.
****************************************************************************************************************************
Collection Interview Questions with JAVA 8

What are Collection related features in Java 8?
Java 8 has brought major changes in the Collection API. Some of the changes are:

Java Stream API for collection classes for supporting sequential as well as parallel processing
Iterable interface is extended with forEach() default method that we can use to iterate over a collection. It is very helpful when used with lambda expressions because its argument Consumer is a function interface.
Miscellaneous Collection API improvements such as forEachRemaining(Consumer action) method in Iterator interface, Map replaceAll(), compute(), merge() methods.

What is Java Collections Framework? List out some benefits of Collections framework?
Collections are used in every programming language and initial java release contained few classes for collections: Vector, Stack, Hashtable, Array. But looking at the larger scope and usage, Java 1.2 came up with Collections Framework that group all the collections interfaces, implementations and algorithms.
Java Collections have come through a long way with the usage of Generics and Concurrent Collection classes for thread-safe operations. It also includes blocking interfaces and their implementations in java concurrent package.
Some of the benefits of collections framework are;

Reduced development effort by using core collection classes rather than implementing our own collection classes.
Code quality is enhanced with the use of well tested collections framework classes.
Reduced effort for code maintenance by using collection classes shipped with JDK.
Reusability and Interoperability

What is the benefit of Generics in Collections Framework?
Java 1.5 came with Generics and all collection interfaces and implementations use it heavily. Generics allow us to provide the type of Object that a collection can contain, so if you try to add any element of other type it throws compile time error.
This avoids ClassCastException at Runtime because you will get the error at compilation. Also Generics make code clean since we don’t need to use casting and instanceof operator. I would highly recommend to go through Java Generic Tutorial to understand generics in a better way.



What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework?
Collection is the root of the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Java platform doesn’t provide any direct implementations of this interface.

Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. This interface models the mathematical set abstraction and is used to represent sets, such as the deck of cards.

List is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements. You can access any element from its index. The list is more like an array with dynamic length.

A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value.

Some other interfaces are Queue, Dequeue, Iterator, SortedSet, SortedMap and ListIterator.


Why Collection doesn’t extend Cloneable and Serializable interfaces?
Collection interface specifies group of Objects known as elements. How the elements are maintained is left up to the concrete implementations of Collection. For example, some Collection implementations like List allow duplicate elements whereas other implementations like Set don’t.
A lot of the Collection implementations have a public clone method. However, it doesn’t make sense to include it in all implementations of Collection. This is because Collection is an abstract representation. What matters is the implementation.
The semantics and the implications of either cloning or serializing come into play when dealing with the actual implementation; so concrete implementation should decide how it should be cloned or serialized, or even if it can be cloned or serialized.
So mandating cloning and serialization in all implementations is less flexible and more restrictive. The specific implementation should decide as to whether it can be cloned or serialized.


Why Map interface doesn’t extend Collection interface?
Although Map interface and its implementations are part of the Collections Framework, Map is not collections and collections are not Map. Hence it doesn’t make sense for Map to extend Collection or vice versa.
If Map extends Collection interface, then where are the elements? The map contains key-value pairs and it provides methods to retrieve the list of Keys or values as Collection but it doesn’t fit into the “group of elements” paradigm.


What is an Iterator?
The Iterator interface provides methods to iterate over any Collection. We can get iterator instance from a Collection using iterator() method. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java Collections Framework. Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration. Java Collection iterator provides a generic way for traversal through the elements of a collection and implements Iterator Design Pattern.


What is difference between Enumeration and Iterator interface?
Enumeration is twice as fast as Iterator and uses very little memory. Enumeration is very basic and fits basic needs. But the Iterator is much safer as compared to Enumeration because it always denies other threads to modify the collection object which is being iterated by it.
Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java Collections Framework. Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection that is not possible with Enumeration. Iterator method names have been improved to make its functionality clear.


Why there is not method like Iterator.add() to add elements to the collection?
The semantics are unclear, given that the contract for Iterator makes no guarantees about the order of iteration. Note, however, that ListIterator does provide an add operation, as it does guarantee the order of the iteration.


Why Iterator don’t have a method to get next element directly without moving the cursor?
It can be implemented on top of current Iterator interface but since its use will be rare, it doesn’t make sense to include it in the interface that everyone has to implement.


What is different between Iterator and ListIterator?
We can use Iterator to traverse Set and List collections whereas ListIterator can be used with Lists only.
Iterator can traverse in forward direction only whereas ListIterator can be used to traverse in both the directions.
ListIterator inherits from Iterator interface and comes with extra functionalities like adding an element, replacing an element, getting index position for previous and next elements.

What are different ways to iterate over a list?
We can iterate over a list in two different ways – using iterator and using for-each loop.


List<String> strList = new ArrayList<>();

//using for-each loop
for(String obj : strList){
    System.out.println(obj);
}

//using iterator
Iterator<String> it = strList.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()){
    String obj = it.next();
    System.out.println(obj);
}
Using iterator is more thread-safe because it makes sure that if underlying list elements are modified, it will throw ConcurrentModificationException.


What do you understand by iterator fail-fast property?
Iterator fail-fast property checks for any modification in the structure of the underlying collection everytime we try to get the next element. If there are any modifications found, it throws ConcurrentModificationException. All the implementations of Iterator in Collection classes are fail-fast by design except the concurrent collection classes like ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList.


What is difference between fail-fast and fail-safe?
Iterator fail-safe property work with the clone of underlying collection, hence it’s not affected by any modification in the collection. By design, all the collection classes in java.util package are fail-fast whereas collection classes in java.util.concurrent are fail-safe.
Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException whereas fail-safe iterator never throws ConcurrentModificationException.
Check this post for CopyOnWriteArrayList Example.


How to avoid ConcurrentModificationException while iterating a collection?
We can use concurrent collection classes to avoid ConcurrentModificationException while iterating over a collection, for example CopyOnWriteArrayList instead of ArrayList.
Check this post for ConcurrentHashMap Example.


Why there are no concrete implementations of Iterator interface?
Iterator interface declare methods for iterating a collection but its implementation is responsibility of the Collection implementation classes. Every collection class that returns an iterator for traversing has its own Iterator implementation nested class.
This allows collection classes to chose whether iterator is fail-fast or fail-safe. For example ArrayList iterator is fail-fast whereas CopyOnWriteArrayList iterator is fail-safe.


What is UnsupportedOperationException?
UnsupportedOperationException is the exception used to indicate that the operation is not supported. It’s used extensively in JDK classes, in collections framework java.util.Collections.UnmodifiableCollection throws this exception for all add and remove operations.


How HashMap works in Java?
HashMap stores key-value pair in Map.Entry static nested class implementation. HashMap works on hashing algorithm and uses hashCode() and equals() method in put and get methods.

When we call put method by passing key-value pair, HashMap uses Key hashCode() with hashing to find out the index to store the key-value pair. The Entry is stored in the LinkedList, so if there is an already existing entry, it uses equals() method to check if the passed key already exists, if yes it overwrites the value else it creates a new entry and stores this key-value Entry.

When we call get method by passing Key, again it uses the hashCode() to find the index in the array and then use equals() method to find the correct Entry and return its value. The below image will explain these detail clearly.

java-hashmap-entry-impl

The other important things to know about HashMap are capacity, load factor, threshold resizing. HashMap initial default capacity is 16 and load factor is 0.75. The threshold is capacity multiplied by load factor and whenever we try to add an entry if map size is greater than the threshold, HashMap rehashes the contents of the map into a new array with a larger capacity. The capacity is always the power of 2, so if you know that you need to store a large number of key-value pairs, for example in caching data from the database, it’s a good idea to initialize the HashMap with correct capacity and load factor.


What is the importance of hashCode() and equals() methods?
HashMap uses the Key object hashCode() and equals() method to determine the index to put the key-value pair. These methods are also used when we try to get value from HashMap. If these methods are not implemented correctly, two different Key’s might produce the same hashCode() and equals() output and in that case, rather than storing it at a different location, HashMap will consider the same and overwrite them.

Similarly all the collection classes that doesn’t store duplicate data use hashCode() and equals() to find duplicates, so it’s very important to implement them correctly. The implementation of equals() and hashCode() should follow these rules.

If o1.equals(o2), then o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()should always be true.
If o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode is true, it doesn’t mean that o1.equals(o2) will be true.

Can we use any class as Map key?
We can use any class as Map Key, however following points should be considered before using them.

If the class overrides equals() method, it should also override hashCode() method.
The class should follow the rules associated with equals() and hashCode() for all instances. Please refer earlier question for these rules.
If a class field is not used in equals(), you should not use it in hashCode() method.
Best practice for user defined key class is to make it immutable, so that hashCode() value can be cached for fast performance. Also immutable classes make sure that hashCode() and equals() will not change in future that will solve any issue with mutability.
For example, let’s say I have a class MyKey that I am using for the HashMap key.

//MyKey name argument passed is used for equals() and hashCode()
MyKey key = new MyKey("Pankaj"); //assume hashCode=1234
myHashMap.put(key, "Value");

// Below code will change the key hashCode() and equals()
// but its location is not changed.
key.setName("Amit"); //assume new hashCode=7890

//below will return null because HashMap will try to look for key
//in the same index as it was stored but since the key is mutated, 
//there will be no match and it will return null.
myHashMap.get(new MyKey("Pankaj")); 
This is the reason why String and Integer are mostly used as HashMap keys.


What are different Collection views provided by Map interface?
Map interface provides three collection views:

Set<K> keySet(): Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator’s remove operation), the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
Collection<V> values(): Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map. The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress (except through the iterator’s remove operation), the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator remove, Collection.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet(): Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator’s remove operation, or the setValue operation on a map entry returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.

What is difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
HashMap and Hashtable both implements Map interface and looks similar, however, there is the following difference between HashMap and Hashtable.

HashMap allows null key and values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow null key and values.
Hashtable is synchronized but HashMap is not synchronized. So HashMap is better for single threaded environment, Hashtable is suitable for multi-threaded environment.
LinkedHashMap was introduced in Java 1.4 as a subclass of HashMap, so incase you want iteration order, you can easily switch from HashMap to LinkedHashMap but that is not the case with Hashtable whose iteration order is unpredictable.
HashMap provides Set of keys to iterate and hence it’s fail-fast but Hashtable provides Enumeration of keys that doesn’t support this feature.
Hashtable is considered to be legacy class and if you are looking for modifications of Map while iterating, you should use ConcurrentHashMap.


How to decide between HashMap and TreeMap?
For inserting, deleting, and locating elements in a Map, the HashMap offers the best alternative. If, however, you need to traverse the keys in a sorted order, then TreeMap is your better alternative. Depending upon the size of your collection, it may be faster to add elements to a HashMap, then convert the map to a TreeMap for sorted key traversal.


What are similarities and difference between ArrayList and Vector?
ArrayList and Vector are similar classes in many ways.

Both are index based and backed up by an array internally.
Both maintains the order of insertion and we can get the elements in the order of insertion.
The iterator implementations of ArrayList and Vector both are fail-fast by design.
ArrayList and Vector both allows null values and random access to element using index number.
These are the differences between ArrayList and Vector.

Vector is synchronized whereas ArrayList is not synchronized. However if you are looking for modification of list while iterating, you should use CopyOnWriteArrayList.
ArrayList is faster than Vector because it doesn’t have any overhead because of synchronization.
ArrayList is more versatile because we can get synchronized list or read-only list from it easily using Collections utility class.

What is difference between Array and ArrayList? When will you use Array over ArrayList?
Arrays can contain primitive or Objects whereas ArrayList can contain only Objects.
Arrays are fixed-size whereas ArrayList size is dynamic.
Arrays don’t provide a lot of features like ArrayList, such as addAll, removeAll, iterator, etc.

Although ArrayList is the obvious choice when we work on the list, there are a few times when an array is good to use.

If the size of list is fixed and mostly used to store and traverse them.
For list of primitive data types, although Collections use autoboxing to reduce the coding effort but still it makes them slow when working on fixed size primitive data types.
If you are working on fixed multi-dimensional situation, using [][] is far more easier than List<List<>>

What is difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList and LinkedList both implement List interface but there are some differences between them.

ArrayList is an index based data structure backed by Array, so it provides random access to its elements with performance as O(1) but LinkedList stores data as list of nodes where every node is linked to its previous and next node. So even though there is a method to get the element using index, internally it traverse from start to reach at the index node and then return the element, so performance is O(n) that is slower than ArrayList.
Insertion, addition or removal of an element is faster in LinkedList compared to ArrayList because there is no concept of resizing array or updating index when element is added in middle.
LinkedList consumes more memory than ArrayList because every node in LinkedList stores reference of previous and next elements.

Which collection classes provide random access of its elements?
ArrayList, HashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable, and Vector classes provide random access to its elements. Download java collections pdf for more information.


What is EnumSet?
java.util.EnumSet is Set implementation to use with enum types. All of the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. EnumSet is not synchronized and null elements are not allowed. It also provides some useful methods like copyOf(Collection c), of(E first, E… rest) and complementOf(EnumSet s).

Check this post for java enum tutorial.


Which collection classes are thread-safe?
Vector, Hashtable, Properties and Stack are synchronized classes, so they are thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded environment. Java 1.5 Concurrent API included some collection classes that allows modification of collection while iteration because they work on the clone of the collection, so they are safe to use in multi-threaded environment.


What are concurrent Collection Classes?
Java 1.5 Concurrent package (java.util.concurrent) contains thread-safe collection classes that allow collections to be modified while iterating. By design Iterator implementation in java.util packages are fail-fast and throws ConcurrentModificationException. But Iterator implementation in java.util.concurrent packages are fail-safe and we can modify the collection while iterating. Some of these classes are CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArraySet.

Read these posts to learn about them in more detail.

Avoid ConcurrentModificationException
CopyOnWriteArrayList Example
HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap

What is BlockingQueue?
java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue is a Queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element.

BlockingQueue interface is part of the java collections framework and it’s primarily used for implementing the producer-consumer problem. We don’t need to worry about waiting for the space to be available for producer or object to be available for consumers in BlockingQueue as it’s handled by implementation classes of BlockingQueue.

Java provides several BlockingQueue implementations such as ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue, SynchronousQueue, etc.
Check this post for use of BlockingQueue for producer-consumer problem.


What is Queue and Stack, list their differences?
Both Queue and Stack are used to store data before processing them. java.util.Queue is an interface whose implementation classes are present in java concurrent package. Queue allows retrieval of element in First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order but it’s not always the case. There is also Deque interface that allows elements to be retrieved from both end of the queue.
The stack is similar to queue except that it allows elements to be retrieved in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
Stack is a class that extends Vector whereas Queue is an interface.


What is Collections Class?
java.util.Collections is a utility class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, “wrappers”, which return a new collection backed by a specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.

This class contains methods for collection framework algorithms, such as binary search, sorting, shuffling, reverse, etc.


What is Comparable and Comparator interface?
Java provides a Comparable interface which should be implemented by any custom class if we want to use Arrays or Collections sorting methods. The comparable interface has a compareTo(T obj) method which is used by sorting methods. We should override this method in such a way that it returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if “this” object is less than, equal to, or greater than the object passed as an argument.

But, in most real-life scenarios, we want sorting based on different parameters. For example, as a CEO, I would like to sort the employees based on Salary, an HR would like to sort them based on age. This is the situation where we need to use Comparator interface because Comparable.compareTo(Object o) method implementation can sort based on one field only and we can’t choose the field on which we want to sort the Object.

Comparator interface compare(Object o1, Object o2) method need to be implemented that takes two Object argument, it should be implemented in such a way that it returns negative int if the first argument is less than the second one and returns zero if they are equal and positive int if the first argument is greater than the second one.

Check this post for use of Comparable and Comparator interface to sort objects.


What is difference between Comparable and Comparator interface?
Comparable and Comparator interfaces are used to sort collection or array of objects.

Comparable interface is used to provide the natural sorting of objects and we can use it to provide sorting based on single logic.
Comparator interface is used to provide different algorithms for sorting and we can choose the comparator we want to use to sort the given collection of objects.


How can we sort a list of Objects?
If we need to sort an array of Objects, we can use Arrays.sort(). If we need to sort a list of objects, we can use Collections.sort(). Both these classes have overloaded sort() methods for natural sorting (using Comparable) or sorting based on criteria (using Comparator).
Collections internally uses Arrays sorting method, so both of them have same performance except that Collections take sometime to convert list to array.


While passing a Collection as argument to a function, how can we make sure the function will not be able to modify it?
We can create a read-only collection using Collections.unmodifiableCollection(Collection c) method before passing it as argument, this will make sure that any operation to change the collection will throw UnsupportedOperationException.


How can we create a synchronized collection from given collection?
We can use Collections.synchronizedCollection(Collection c) to get a synchronized (thread-safe) collection backed by the specified collection.


What are common algorithms implemented in Collections Framework?
Java Collections Framework provides algorithm implementations that are commonly used such as sorting and searching. Collections class contain these method implementations. Most of these algorithms work on List but some of them are applicable for all kinds of collections.
Some of them are sorting, searching, shuffling, min-max values.


What is Big-O notation? Give some examples?
The Big-O notation describes the performance of an algorithm in terms of the number of elements in a data structure. Since Collection classes are data structures, we usually tend to use Big-O notation to chose the collection implementation to use based on time, memory and performance.

Example 1: ArrayList get(index i) is a constant-time operation and doesn’t depend on the number of elements in the list. So its performance in Big-O notation is O(1).
Example 2: A linear search on array or list performance is O(n) because we need to search through entire list of elements to find the element.


What are best practices related to Java Collections Framework?
Chosing the right type of collection based on the need, for example if size is fixed, we might want to use Array over ArrayList. If we have to iterate over the Map in order of insertion, we need to use LinkedHashMap. If we don’t want duplicates, we should use Set.
Some collection classes allows to specify the initial capacity, so if we have an estimate of number of elements we will store, we can use it to avoid rehashing or resizing.
Write program in terms of interfaces not implementations, it allows us to change the implementation easily at later point of time.
Always use Generics for type-safety and avoid ClassCastException at runtime.
Use immutable classes provided by JDK as key in Map to avoid implementation of hashCode() and equals() for our custom class.
Use Collections utility class as much as possible for algorithms or to get read-only, synchronized or empty collections rather than writing own implementation. It will enhance code-reuse with greater stability and low maintainability.

What is Java Priority Queue?
PriorityQueue is an unbounded queue based on a priority heap and the elements are ordered in their natural order or we can provide Comparator for ordering at the time of creation. PriorityQueue doesn’t allow null values and we can’t add any object that doesn’t provide natural ordering or we don’t have any comparator for them for ordering. Java PriorityQueue is not thread-safe and provided O(log(n)) time for enqueing and dequeing operations. Check this post for java priority queue example.


Why can’t we write code as List<Number> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();?
Generics doesn’t support sub-typing because it will cause issues in achieving type safety. That’s why List<T> is not considered as a subtype of List<S> where S is the super-type of T. To understanding why it’s not allowed, let’s see what could have happened if it has been supported.


List<Long> listLong = new ArrayList<Long>();
listLong.add(Long.valueOf(10));
List<Number> listNumbers = listLong; // compiler error
listNumbers.add(Double.valueOf(1.23));
As you can see from above code that IF generics would have been supporting sub-typing, we could have easily add a Double to the list of Long that would have caused ClassCastException at runtime while traversing the list of Long.


Why can’t we create generic array? or write code as List<Integer>[] array = new ArrayList<Integer>[10];
We are not allowed to create generic arrays because array carry type information of its elements at runtime. This information is used at runtime to throw ArrayStoreException if elements type doesn’t match to the defined type. Since generics type information gets erased at compile time by Type Erasure, the array store check would have been passed where it should have failed. Let’s understand this with a simple example code.


List<Integer>[] intList = new List<Integer>[5]; // compile error
Object[] objArray = intList;
List<Double> doubleList = new ArrayList<Double>();
doubleList.add(Double.valueOf(1.23));
objArray[0] = doubleList; // this should fail but it would pass because at runtime intList and doubleList both are just List
Arrays are covariant by nature i.e S[] is a subtype of T[] whenever S is a subtype of T but generics doesn’t support covariance or sub-typing as we saw in the last question. So if we would have been allowed to create generic arrays, because of type erasure we would not get an array store exception even though both types are not related.

OOPS Java Interview Questions
Q1. What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is briefly described as “one interface, many implementations”. Polymorphism is a characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts – specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. There are two types of polymorphism:

Compile time polymorphism
Run time polymorphism
Compile time polymorphism is method overloading whereas Runtime time polymorphism is done using inheritance and interface.

Q2. What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch?
In Java, runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time. In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.


class Car {
void run()
{
System.out.println(&ldquo;car is running&rdquo;); 
}
}
class Audi extends Car {
void run()
{
System.out.prinltn(&ldquo;Audi is running safely with 100km&rdquo;);
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
Car b= new Audi();    //upcasting
b.run();
}
}
Q3. What is abstraction in Java?
Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user. Thus you can say that abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and revealing only the functionality to them. Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:

Abstract Classes (0-100% of abstraction can be achieved)
Interfaces (100% of abstraction can be achieved)
Q4. What do you mean by an interface in Java?
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants. In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. Thus, interface basically is a group of related methods with empty bodies. Example:

public interface Animal {
  public void eat();
  public void sleep();
  public void run();
}
Q5. What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces?
Abstract Class	Interfaces
An abstract class can provide complete, default code and/or just the details that have to be overridden	An interface cannot provide any code at all, just the signature
In the case of an abstract class, a class may extend only one abstract class	A Class may implement several interfaces
An abstract class can have non-abstract methods	All methods of an Interface are abstract
An abstract class can have instance variables	An Interface cannot have instance variables
An abstract class can have any visibility: public, private, protected	An Interface visibility must be public (or) none
If we add a new method to an abstract class then we have the option of providing default implementation and therefore all the existing code might work properly	If we add a new method to an Interface then we have to track down all the implementations of the interface and define implementation for the new method
An abstract class can contain constructors	An Interface cannot contain constructors
Abstract classes are fast	Interfaces are slow as it requires extra indirection to find the corresponding method in the actual class
Q6. What is inheritance in Java?

Inheritance in Java is the concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes. Inheritance is performed between two types of classes:

Parent class (Super or Base class)
Child class (Subclass or Derived class)

A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.

Q7. What are the different types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports four types of inheritance which are:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.
Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.
Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.
Q8. What is method overloading and method overriding?
Method Overloading :
In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have a different number of parameters or parameters having different types and order.
Method Overloading is to “add” or “extend” more to the method’s behavior.
It is a compile-time polymorphism.
The methods must have a different signature.
It may or may not need inheritance in Method Overloading.
Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

Course Curriculum
Java, J2EE & SOA Certification Training
Instructor-led SessionsReal-life Case StudiesAssignmentsLifetime Access

class Adder {
Static int add(int a, int b)
{
return a+b;
}
Static double add( double a, double b)
{
return a+b;
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11));
System.out.println(Adder.add(12.3,12.6));
}}
Method Overriding:  
In Method Overriding, the subclass has the same method with the same name and exactly the same number and type of parameters and same return type as a superclass.
Method Overriding is to “Change” existing behavior of the method.
It is a run time polymorphism.
The methods must have the same signature.
It always requires inheritance in Method Overriding.
Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

class Car {
void run(){
System.out.println(&ldquo;car is running&rdquo;); 
}
Class Audi extends Car{
void run()
{
System.out.prinltn("Audi is running safely with 100km");
}
public static void main( String args[])
{
Car b=new Audi();
b.run();
}
}
Q9. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with the same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the superclass method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in subclass because it’s not accessible there. What you can do is create another private method with the same name in the child class. Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

class Base {
private static void display() {
System.out.println("Static or class method from Base");
}
public void print() {
System.out.println("Non-static or instance method from Base");
}
class Derived extends Base {
private static void display() {
System.out.println("Static or class method from Derived");
}
public void print() {
System.out.println("Non-static or instance method from Derived");
}
public class test {
public static void main(String args[])
{
Base obj= new Derived();
obj1.display();
obj1.print();
}
}
Q10. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
MultipleInheritance - Java Interview Questions - EdurekaIf a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.

The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.

Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.

Q11. What is encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data(variables) and code(methods) together as a single unit. Here, the data is hidden from the outer world and can be accessed only via current class methods. This helps in protecting the data from any unnecessary modification. We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:

Declaring the variables of a class as private.
Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the values of the variables.
Q12. What is an association?
Association is a relationship where all object have their own lifecycle and there is no owner. Let’s take the example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. These relationships can be one to one, one to many, many to one and many to many.

Q13. What do you mean by aggregation?
An aggregation is a specialized form of Association where all object has their own lifecycle but there is ownership and child object can not belong to another parent object. Let’s take an example of Department and teacher. A single teacher can not belong to multiple departments, but if we delete the department teacher object will not destroy. 

Q14. What is composition in Java?
Composition is again a specialized form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death” relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have their lifecycle and if parent object deletes all child object will also be deleted. Let’s take again an example of a relationship between House and rooms. House can contain multiple rooms there is no independent life of room and any room can not belongs to two different houses if we delete the house room will automatically delete.

Q15. What is a marker interface?

A Marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member functions. In simpler terms, an empty interface is called the Marker interface. The most common examples of Marker interface in Java are Serializable, Cloneable etc. The marker interface can be declared as follows.


public interface Serializable{
}
Q16. What is object cloning in Java?

Object cloning in Java is the process of creating an exact copy of an object. It basically means the ability to create an object with a similar state as the original object. To achieve this, Java provides a method clone() to make use of this functionality. This method creates a new instance of the class of the current object and then initializes all its fields with the exact same contents of corresponding fields. To object clone(), the marker interface java.lang.Cloneable must be implemented to avoid any runtime exceptions. One thing you must note is Object clone() is a protected method, thus you need to override it.

Q17. What is a copy constructor in Java?
Copy constructor is a member function that is used to initialize an object using another object of the same class. Though there is no need for copy constructor in Java since all objects are passed by reference. Moreover, Java does not even support automatic pass-by-value.

Q18. What is a constructor overloading in Java?
In Java, constructor overloading is a technique of adding any number of constructors to a class each having a different parameter list. The compiler uses the number of parameters and their types in the list to differentiate the overloaded constructors.


class Demo
{
int i;
public Demo(int a)
{
i=k;
}
public Demo(int a, int b)
{
//body
}
}

Servlets Interview Questions  
Q1. What is a servlet?
Java Servlet is server-side technologies to extend the capability of web servers by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes for writing our own servlets.
All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-specific services.
Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below image.
Servlet - Java Interview Questions - Edureka

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get	Post
Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header.	Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body.
 Not Secured because data is exposed in URL bar.	 Secured because data is not exposed in URL bar.
 Can be bookmarked	 Cannot be bookmarked
 Idempotent	 Non-Idempotent
 It is more efficient and used than Post	 It is less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include the content of another resource to the response.

There are two methods defined in this interface:

1.void forward()

2.void include()

ForwardMethod - Java Interview Questions - Edureka
IncludeMethod - Java Interview Questions - Edureka
Q4. What are the differences between forward() method and sendRedirect() methods?

forward() method	SendRedirect() method
forward() sends the same request to another resource.	sendRedirect() method sends new request always because it uses the URL bar of the browser.
 forward() method works at server side.	 sendRedirect() method works at client side.
 forward() method works within the server only.	sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:LifeCycleServlet - Java Interview Questions - Edureka

Servlet is loaded
Servlet is instantiated
Servlet is initialized
Service the request
Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client local machine.
Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no methods to set or add cookie to request.
Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below tabular format.

ServletConfig	ServletContext
Servlet config object represent single servlet	It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and common for all the servlet
Its like local parameter associated with particular servlet	Its like global parameter associated with whole application
It’s a name value pair defined inside the servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope	ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml file.
getServletConfig() method is used to get the config object	getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object.
for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to particular user so here we can use servlet config	To get the MIME type of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object.

Q8. What are the different methods of session management in servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and response.

Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:

User Authentication
HTML Hidden Field
Cookies
URL Rewriting
Session Management API

JDBC Interview Questions 
1. What is JDBC Driver?
JDBC Driver is a software component that enables java application to interact with the database. There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:

JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
Native-API driver (partially java driver)
Network Protocol driver (fully java driver)
Thin driver (fully java driver)
2. What are the steps to connect to a database in java?
Registering the driver class
Creating connection
Creating statement
Executing queries
Closing connection
3. What are the JDBC API components?
The java.sql package contains interfaces and classes for JDBC API.

Interfaces:
Connection
Statement
PreparedStatement
ResultSet
ResultSetMetaData
DatabaseMetaData
CallableStatement etc.
Classes:
DriverManager
Blob
Clob
Types
SQLException etc.
4. What is the role of JDBC DriverManager class?
The DriverManager class manages the registered drivers. It can be used to register and unregister drivers. It provides factory method that returns the instance of Connection.

5. What is JDBC Connection interface?
The Connection interface maintains a session with the database. It can be used for transaction management. It provides factory methods that returns the instance of Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement and DatabaseMetaData.

ConnectionInterface - Java Interview Questions - Edureka
6.  What is the purpose of JDBC ResultSet interface?
The ResultSet object represents a row of a table. It can be used to change the cursor pointer and get the information from the database.

7. What is JDBC ResultSetMetaData interface?
The ResultSetMetaData interface returns the information of table such as total number of columns, column name, column type etc.

8. What is JDBC DatabaseMetaData interface?
The DatabaseMetaData interface returns the information of the database such as username, driver name, driver version, number of tables, number of views etc.

9. What do you mean by batch processing in JDBC?
Batch processing helps you to group related SQL statements into a batch and execute them instead of executing a single query. By using batch processing technique in JDBC, you can execute multiple queries which makes the performance faster.

10. What is the difference between execute, executeQuery, executeUpdate?
Statement execute(String query) is used to execute any SQL query and it returns TRUE if the result is an ResultSet such as running Select queries. The output is FALSE when there is no ResultSet object such as running Insert or Update queries. We can use getResultSet() to get the ResultSet and getUpdateCount() method to retrieve the update count.

Statement executeQuery(String query) is used to execute Select queries and returns the ResultSet. ResultSet returned is never null even if there are no records matching the query. When executing select queries we should use executeQuery method so that if someone tries to execute insert/update statement it will throw java.sql.SQLException with message “executeQuery method can not be used for update”.

Statement executeUpdate(String query) is used to execute Insert/Update/Delete (DML) statements or DDL statements that returns nothing. The output is int and equals to the row count for SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. For DDL statements, the output is 0.

You should use execute() method only when you are not sure about the type of statement else use executeQuery or executeUpdate method.

Q11. What do you understand by JDBC Statements?
JDBC statements are basically the statements which are used to send SQL commands to the database and retrieve data back from the database. Various methods like execute(), executeUpdate(), executeQuery, etc. are provided by JDBC to interact with the database.

JDBC supports 3 types of statements:

Statement: Used for general purpose access to the database and executes a static SQL query at runtime.
PreparedStatement: Used to provide input parameters to the query during execution.
CallableStatement: Used to access the database stored procedures and helps in accepting runtime parameters.

Singleton: Only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans. While using this scope, make sure spring bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues because it’s not thread-safe.
Prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.
Request: This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.
Session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.
Global-session: This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.
Q5. Explain the role of DispatcherServlet and ContextLoaderListener.
DispatcherServlet is basically the front controller in the Spring MVC application as it loads the spring bean configuration file and initializes all the beans that have been configured. If annotations are enabled, it also scans the packages to configure any bean annotated with @Component, @Controller, @Repository or @Service annotations.

DispatcherServlet - Java Interview Questions - EdurekaContextLoaderListener, on the other hand, is the listener to start up and shut down the WebApplicationContext in Spring root. Some of its important functions includes tying up the lifecycle of Application Context to the lifecycle of the ServletContext and automating the creation of ApplicationContext.

ContextLoader - Java Interview Questions - Edureka
Q6. What are the differences between constructor injection and setter injection?
No.	Constructor Injection	Setter Injection
 1)	 No Partial Injection	 Partial Injection
 2)	 Doesn’t override the setter property	 Overrides the constructor property if both are defined.
 3)	Creates a new instance if any modification occurs	Doesn’t create a new instance if you change the property value
 4) 	 Better for too many properties	 Better for a few properties.
Q7. What is autowiring in Spring? What are the autowiring modes?
Autowiring enables the programmer to inject the bean automatically. We don’t need to write explicit injection logic. Let’s see the code to inject bean using dependency injection.

Programming & Frameworks Training
<bean id=“emp” class=“com.javatpoint.Employee” autowire=“byName” />  
The autowiring modes are given below:

No.	Mode	Description
 1)	 no	 this is the default mode, it means autowiring is not enabled.
 2)	 byName	 Injects the bean based on the property name. It uses setter method.
 3)	 byType	 Injects the bean based on the property type. It uses setter method.
 4)	 constructor	 It injects the bean using constructor
Q8. How to handle exceptions in Spring MVC Framework?
Spring MVC Framework provides the following ways to help us achieving robust exception handling.

Controller Based:
We can define exception handler methods in our controller classes. All we need is to annotate these methods with @ExceptionHandler annotation.

Global Exception Handler:
Exception Handling is a cross-cutting concern and Spring provides @ControllerAdvice annotation that we can use with any class to define our global exception handler.

HandlerExceptionResolver implementation: 
For generic exceptions, most of the times we serve static pages. Spring Framework provides HandlerExceptionResolver interface that we can implement to create global exception handler. The reason behind this additional way to define global exception handler is that Spring framework also provides default implementation classes that we can define in our spring bean configuration file to get spring framework exception handling benefits.


Q9. What are some of the important Spring annotations which you have used?
Some of the Spring annotations that I have used in my project are:

@Controller – for controller classes in Spring MVC project.

@RequestMapping – for configuring URI mapping in controller handler methods. This is a very important annotation, so you should go through Spring MVC RequestMapping Annotation Examples

@ResponseBody – for sending Object as response, usually for sending XML or JSON data as response.

@PathVariable – for mapping dynamic values from the URI to handler method arguments.

@Autowired – for autowiring dependencies in spring beans.

@Qualifier – with @Autowired annotation to avoid confusion when multiple instances of bean type is present.

@Service – for service classes.

@Scope – for configuring the scope of the spring bean.

@Configuration, @ComponentScan and @Bean – for java based configurations.

AspectJ annotations for configuring aspects and advices , @Aspect, @Before, @After, @Around, @Pointcut, etc.

Q10. How to integrate Spring and Hibernate Frameworks?
We can use Spring ORM module to integrate Spring and Hibernate frameworks if you are using Hibernate 3+ where SessionFactory provides current session, then you should avoid using HibernateTemplate or HibernateDaoSupport classes and better to use DAO pattern with dependency injection for the integration.

Also, Spring ORM provides support for using Spring declarative transaction management, so you should utilize that rather than going for hibernate boiler-plate code for transaction management. 

Q11. Name the types of transaction management that Spring supports.
Two types of transaction management are supported by Spring. They are:

Programmatic transaction management: In this, the transaction is managed with the help of programming. It provides you extreme flexibility, but it is very difficult to maintain.
Declarative transaction management: In this, transaction management is separated from the business code. Only annotations or XML based configurations are used to manage the transactions.

Hibernate Interview Questions
1. What is Hibernate Framework?
Object-relational mapping or ORM is the programming technique to map application domain model objects to the relational database tables. Hibernate is Java-based ORM tool that provides a framework for mapping application domain objects to the relational database tables and vice versa.

Hibernate provides a reference implementation of Java Persistence API, that makes it a great choice as ORM tool with benefits of loose coupling. We can use the Hibernate persistence API for CRUD operations. Hibernate framework provide option to map plain old java objects to traditional database tables with the use of JPA annotations as well as XML based configuration.

Similarly, hibernate configurations are flexible and can be done from XML configuration file as well as programmatically.

2. What are the important benefits of using Hibernate Framework?
Some of the important benefits of using hibernate framework are:

Hibernate eliminates all the boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC and takes care of managing resources, so we can focus on business logic.
Hibernate framework provides support for XML as well as JPA annotations, that makes our code implementation independent.
Hibernate provides a powerful query language (HQL) that is similar to SQL. However, HQL is fully object-oriented and understands concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and association.
Hibernate is an open source project from Red Hat Community and used worldwide. This makes it a better choice than others because learning curve is small and there are tons of online documentation and help is easily available in forums.
Hibernate is easy to integrate with other Java EE frameworks, it’s so popular that Spring Framework provides built-in support for integrating hibernate with Spring applications.
Hibernate supports lazy initialization using proxy objects and perform actual database queries only when it’s required.
Hibernate cache helps us in getting better performance.
For database vendor specific feature, hibernate is suitable because we can also execute native sql queries.
Overall hibernate is the best choice in current market for ORM tool, it contains all the features that you will ever need in an ORM tool.

3. Explain Hibernate architecture.
HibernateArchitecture - Java Interview Questions - Edureka

4. What are the differences between get and load methods?
The differences between get() and load() methods are given below.

No.	get()	load()
 1)	 Returns null if object is not found.	Throws ObjectNotFoundException if an object is not found.
 2)	 get() method always hit the database.	 load() method doesn’t hit the database.
 3)	 It returns a real object, not a proxy.	 It returns a proxy object.
 4)	It should be used if you are not sure about the existence of instance.	It should be used if you are sure that the instance exists.
5. What are the advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?
Some of the important advantages of Hibernate framework over JDBC are:

Hibernate removes a lot of boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC API, the code looks cleaner and readable.
Hibernate supports inheritance, associations, and collections. These features are not present with JDBC API.
Hibernate implicitly provides transaction management, in fact, most of the queries can’t be executed outside transaction. In JDBC API, we need to write code for transaction management using commit and rollback. 
JDBC API throws SQLException that is a checked exception, so we need to write a lot of try-catch block code. Most of the times it’s redundant in every JDBC call and used for transaction management. Hibernate wraps JDBC exceptions and throw JDBCException or HibernateException un-checked exception, so we don’t need to write code to handle it. Hibernate built-in transaction management removes the usage of try-catch blocks.
Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is more object-oriented and close to Java programming language. For JDBC, we need to write native SQL queries.
Hibernate supports caching that is better for performance, JDBC queries are not cached hence performance is low.
Hibernate provides option through which we can create database tables too, for JDBC tables must exist in the database.
Hibernate configuration helps us in using JDBC like connection as well as JNDI DataSource for the connection pool. This is a very important feature in enterprise application and completely missing in JDBC API.
Hibernate supports JPA annotations, so the code is independent of the implementation and easily replaceable with other ORM tools. JDBC code is very tightly coupled with the application.

Java Interview Questions: JSP
1. What are the life-cycle methods for a jsp?
Methods	Description
 public void jspInit()	It is invoked only once, same as init method of servlet.
public void _jspService(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse)throws ServletException,IOException	It is invoked at each request, same as service() method of servlet.
 public void jspDestroy()	It is invoked only once, same as destroy() method of servlet.
2. What are the JSP implicit objects?
JSP provides 9 implicit objects by default. They are as follows:

Object	Type
1) out	 JspWriter
2) request	 HttpServletRequest
3) response	 HttpServletResponse
4) config	 ServletConfig
5) session	 HttpSession
6) application	 ServletContext
7) pageContext	 PageContext
8) page	 Object
9) exception	 Throwable
3. What are the differences between include directive and include action?
include directive	include action
The include directive includes the content at page translation time.	The include action includes the content at request time.
The include directive includes the original content of the page so page size increases at runtime.	The include action doesn’t include the original content rather invokes the include() method of Vendor provided class.
 It’s better for static pages.	 It’s better for dynamic pages.
4. How to disable caching on back button of the browser?
<%
response.setHeader(“Cache-Control”,”no-store”);
response.setHeader(“Pragma”,”no-cache”);
response.setHeader (“Expires”, “0”);                    //prevents caching at the proxy server
%>   

5. What are the different tags provided in JSTL?
There are 5 type of JSTL tags.

core tags
sql tags
xml tags
internationalization tags
functions tags
6. How to disable session in JSP?
<%@ page session=“false” %>   
7.  How to delete a Cookie in a JSP?
The following code explains how to delete a Cookie in a JSP :

Cookie mycook = new Cookie("name1","value1");
 
response.addCookie(mycook1);
 
Cookie killmycook = new Cookie("mycook1","value1");
 
killmycook . set MaxAge ( 0 );
 
killmycook . set Path ("/");
 
killmycook . addCookie ( killmycook 1 );
8. Explain the jspDestroy() method.
jspDestry() method is invoked from javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface whenever a JSP page is about to be destroyed. Servlets destroy methods can be easily overridden to perform cleanup, like when closing a database connection.

9.  How is JSP better than Servlet technology?
JSP is a technology on the server’s side to make content generation simple. They are document-centric, whereas servlets are programs. A Java server page can contain fragments of Java program, which execute and instantiate Java classes. However, they occur inside an HTML template file. It provides the framework for the development of a Web Application.

10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in web.xml?

We don’t need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml because when container loads the web application and find TLD files, it automatically configures them to be used directly in the application JSP pages. We just need to include it in the JSP page using taglib directive.

11. How will you use JSP EL in order to get the HTTP method name?
Using pageContext JSP EL implicit object you can get the request object reference and make use of the dot operator to retrieve the HTTP method name in the JSP page. The JSP EL code for this purpose will look like ${pageContext.request.method}.

Exception and Thread Java Interview Questions
Q1. What is the difference between Error and Exception?
An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error. These JVM errors you cannot repair them at runtime. Though error can be caught in the catch block but the execution of application will come to a halt and is not recoverable.

While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input or human error etc. e.g. FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference. In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving the user feedback for entering proper values etc.

Q2. How can you handle Java exceptions?
There are five keywords used to handle exceptions in Java: 

try
catch
finally
throw
throws
Q3. What are the differences between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?
Checked Exception
The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. 
Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
Example: IOException, SQLException etc.
Unchecked Exception
The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. 
Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.
Example: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException etc.
Q4. What purpose do the keywords final, finally, and finalize fulfill? 
Final:
Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method, and variable. A final class can’t be inherited, final method can’t be overridden and final variable value can’t be changed. Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.

class FinalVarExample {
public static void main( String args[])
{
final int a=10;   // Final variable
a=50;             //Error as value can't be changed
}
Finally
Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether the exception is handled or not. Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.


class FinallyExample {
public static void main(String args[]){
try {
int x=100;
}
catch(Exception e) {
System.out.println(e);
}
finally {
System.out.println("finally block is executing");}
}}
}
Finalize
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before the object is garbage collected. Let’s take a look at the example below to understand it better.


class FinalizeExample {
public void finalize() {
System.out.println("Finalize is called");
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
FinalizeExample f1=new FinalizeExample();
FinalizeExample f2=new FinalizeExample();
f1= NULL;
f2=NULL;
System.gc();
}
}
 Q5. What are the differences between throw and throws? 
throw keyword	throws keyword
Throw is used to explicitly throw an exception.	Throws is used to declare an exception.
Checked exceptions can not be propagated with throw only.	Checked exception can be propagated with throws.
Throw is followed by an instance.	Throws is followed by class.
Throw is used within the method.	Throws is used with the method signature.
You cannot throw multiple exception	You can declare multiple exception e.g. public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.
Q6. What is exception hierarchy in java?
The hierarchy is as follows:

Course Curriculum
Java, J2EE & SOA Certification Training
Weekday / Weekend Batches
Throwable is a parent class of all Exception classes. There are two types of Exceptions: Checked exceptions and UncheckedExceptions or RunTimeExceptions. Both type of exceptions extends Exception class whereas errors are further classified into Virtual Machine error and Assertion error.

ExceptionHierarchy - Java Interview Questions - Edureka

Q7. How to create a custom Exception?
To create you own exception extend the Exception class or any of its subclasses.

class New1Exception extends Exception { }               // this will create Checked Exception
class NewException extends IOException { }             // this will create Checked exception
class NewException extends NullPonterExcpetion { }  // this will create UnChecked exception
Q8. What are the important methods of Java Exception Class?
Exception and all of it’s subclasses doesn’t provide any specific methods and all of the methods are defined in the base class Throwable.

String getMessage() – This method returns the message String of Throwable and the message can be provided while creating the exception through it’s constructor.
String getLocalizedMessage() – This method is provided so that subclasses can override it to provide locale specific message to the calling program. Throwable class implementation of this method simply use getMessage() method to return the exception message.
Synchronized Throwable getCause() – This method returns the cause of the exception or null id the cause is unknown.
String toString() – This method returns the information about Throwable in String format, the returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized message.
void printStackTrace() – This method prints the stack trace information to the standard error stream, this method is overloaded and we can pass PrintStream or PrintWriter as an argument to write the stack trace information to the file or stream.
Q9. What are the differences between processes and threads?
 	Process	Thread
Definition	An executing instance of a program is called a process.	A thread is a subset of the process.
Communication	Processes must use inter-process communication to communicate with sibling processes.	Threads can directly communicate with other threads of its process.
Control	Processes can only exercise control over child processes.	Threads can exercise considerable control over threads of the same process.
Changes	Any change in the parent process does not affect child processes.	Any change in the main thread may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process.
Memory	Run in separate memory spaces.	Run in shared memory spaces.
Controlled by	Process is controlled by the operating system.	Threads are controlled by programmer in a program.
Dependence	Processes are independent.	Threads are dependent.
Q10. What is a finally block? Is there a case when finally will not execute?
Finally block is a block which always executes a set of statements. It is always associated with a try block regardless of any exception that occurs or not. 
Yes, finally will not be executed if the program exits either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort.

Q11. What is synchronization?
Synchronization refers to multi-threading. A synchronized block of code can be executed by only one thread at a time. As Java supports execution of multiple threads, two or more threads may access the same fields or objects. Synchronization is a process which keeps all concurrent threads in execution to be in sync. Synchronization avoids memory consistency errors caused due to inconsistent view of shared memory. When a method is declared as synchronized the thread holds the monitor for that method’s object. If another thread is executing the synchronized method the thread is blocked until that thread releases the monitor. 

Synchronization - Java Interview Questions - Edureka

 Q12. Can we write multiple catch blocks under single try block? 
Yes we can have multiple catch blocks under single try block but the approach should be from specific to general. Let’s understand this with a programmatic example.

public class Example {
public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
int a[]= new int[10];
a[10]= 10/0;
}
catch(ArithmeticException e)
{
System.out.println("Arithmetic exception in first catch block");
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
{
System.out.println("Array index out of bounds in second catch block");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Any exception in third catch block");
}
}
Q13. What are the important methods of Java Exception Class?
Methods are defined in the base class Throwable. Some of the important methods of Java exception class are stated below. 

String getMessage() – This method returns the message String about the exception. The message can be provided through its constructor.
public StackTraceElement[] getStackTrace() – This method returns an array containing each element on the stack trace. The element at index 0 represents the top of the call stack whereas the last element in the array represents the method at the bottom of the call stack.
Synchronized Throwable getCause() – This method returns the cause of the exception or null id as represented by a Throwable object.

String toString() – This method returns the information in String format. The returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized message.
void printStackTrace() – This method prints the stack trace information to the standard error stream. 
Q14. What is OutOfMemoryError in Java?
OutOfMemoryError is the subclass of java.lang.Error which generally occurs when our JVM runs out of memory.

Q15. What is a Thread?
A thread is the smallest piece of programmed instructions which can be executed independently by a scheduler. In Java, all the programs will have at least one thread which is known as the main thread. This main thread is created by the JVM when the program starts its execution. The main thread is used to invoke the main() of the program.

Q16. What are the two ways to create a thread?
In Java, threads can be created in the following two ways:- 

By implementing the Runnable interface.
By extending the Thread
Q17. What are the different types of garbage collectors in Java?
Garbage collection in Java a program which helps in implicit memory management. Since in Java, using the new keyword you can create objects dynamically, which once created will consume some memory. Once the job is done and there are no more references left to the object, Java using garbage collection destroys the object and relieves the memory occupied by it. Java provides four types of garbage collectors:

Serial Garbage Collector
Parallel Garbage Collector
CMS Garbage Collector
G1 Garbage Collector

*************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Java 8 Interview questions:-

1)  What are new features which got introduced in Java 8?
There are lots of new features which were added in Java 8. Here is the list of important features:

Lambda Expression
Default methods in the interface
Functional Interface
Optional
Method references
Date API
Stream API
Nashorn, JavaScript Engine
2) What are main advantages of using Java 8?
More compact code
Less boiler plate code
More readable and reusable code
More testable code
Parallel operations
3) What is lambda expression?
Lambda expression is anonymous function which have set of parameters and a lambda (->) and a function body .You can call it function without name.

Structure of Lambda Expressions

(Argument List) ->{expression;} or
(Argument List) ->{statements;}
 
 Let see a simple example of thread execution:

public class ThreadSample {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  // old way
  new Thread(new Runnable() {
   
   @Override
   public void run() {
    System.out.println("Thread is started");
   }
  }).start();
 
  // using lambda Expression
  new Thread(()->System.out.println("Thread is started")).start();
 }
 
}
 
You can refer to lambda expression in java for more details.

4) Can you explain the syntax of Lambda expression?
So we can divide structure of Lambda expression to three parts:

1. Argument list or parameters
Lambda expression can have zero or more arguments.

()->{System.out.println("Hello")}; //Without argument, will print hello 
(int a)->{System.out.println(a)} //; One argument, will print value of a
(int a,int b)-> {a+b};//two argument, will return sum of these two integers
 

You can choose to not declare type of arguments as it can be inferred from context.

(a,b)->{a+b};//two argument, will return sum of these two numbers
 

you can not declare one argument’s type and do not declare type for other argument.

(int a,b)->{a+b};//Compilation error
 

When there is a single parameter, if its type is inferred, it is not mandatory to use parentheses

a->{System.out.println(a)}; // Will print value of number a
 

2. Array token (->)
3. Body

Body can have expression or statements.
If there is only one statement in body,curly brace is not needed and return type of the anonymous function is same as of  body expression
If there are more than one statements, then it should be in curly braces and return type of anonymous function is same as value return from code block, void if nothing is returned.
5) What are functional interfaces?
Functional interfaces are those interfaces which can have only one abstract method.It can have static method, default methods or can override Object’s class methods.

There are many functional interfaces already present in java such as Comparable, Runnable.

As we have only one method in Runnable, hence it is considered as functional interface.

You can read more about the functional interface.

6) How lambda expression and functional interfaces are related?
Lambda expressions can only be applied to abstract method of functional interface.
For example

Runnable has only one abstract method called run, so it can be used as below:


// Using lambda expression
Thread t1=new Thread(
()->System.out.println("In Run method")
);
 
Here we are using Thread constructor which takes Runnable as parameter. As you can see we did not specify any function name here, as Runnable has only one abstract method, java will implicitly create anonymous Runnable and execute run method.
It will be as good as below code.

Thread t1=new Thread(new Runnable() { 
   @Override
   public void run() {
    System.out.println("In Run method");
   }
  });
 
7) Can you create your own functional interface?
Yes, you can create your own functional interface. Java can implicitly identify functional interface but you can also annotate it with @FunctionalInterface.
Example:
Create interface named “Printable” as below

package org.arpit.java2blog;
 
public interface Printable {
 
	void print();
	default void printColor()
	{
		System.out.println("Printing Color copy");
	}
}
 
Create main class named “FunctionalIntefaceMain”

package org.arpit.java2blog.constructor;
 
public class FunctionalIntefaceMain {
 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		FunctionalIntefaceMain pMain=new FunctionalIntefaceMain();
		pMain.printForm(() -> System.out.println("Printing form"));
	}
	
	public void printForm(Printable p)
	{
		p.print();
	}
}
 
When you run above program, you will get below output:

Printing form
As you can see, since Printable has only one abstract method called print(), we were able to call it using lambda expression.

8) What is method reference in java 8?
Method reference is used refer method of functional interface. It is nothing but compact way of lambda expression.You can simply replace lambda expression with method reference.
Syntax:
class::methodname

9) What is Optional? Why and how can you use it?
Java 8 has introduced new class Called Optional. This class is basically introduced to avoid NullPointerException in java.
Optional class encapsulates optional value which is either present or not.
It is a wrapper around object and can be use to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
Let’s take a simple example

You have written below function to get first non repeated character in String.

 
public static Character getNonRepeatedCharacter(String str) {
	Map<Character, Integer> countCharacters = new LinkedHashMap<Character, Integer>();
		  for (int i = 0; i < str.length() - 1; i++) {
		   Character c = str.charAt(i);
		   if (!countCharacters.containsKey(c)) {
		    countCharacters.put(c, 1);
		   } else {
		    countCharacters.put(c, countCharacters.get(c) + 1);
		   }
		  }
		  // As LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order, first character with
		  // count 1 should return first non repeated character
		  for (Entry<Character, Integer> e : countCharacters.entrySet()) {
		   if (e.getValue() == 1)
		    return e.getKey();
		 
		  }
		  return null;
		 
		 }
 
You call above method as below.

	Character c=getNonRepeatedCharacter("SASAS");
	System.out.println("Non repeated character is :"+c.toString());
 
Do you see the problem, there is no non repeating character for getNonRepeatedCharacter(“SASAS”) hence it will return null and we are calling c.toString, so it will obviously throw NullPointerException.
You can use Optional to avoid this NullPointerException.
Let’s change the method to return Optional object rather than String.

public static Optional<Character> getNonRepeatedCharacterOpt(String str) {
		  Map<Character, Integer> countCharacters = new LinkedHashMap<Character, Integer>();
		  for (int i = 0; i < str.length() - 1; i++) {
		   Character c = str.charAt(i);
		   if (!countCharacters.containsKey(c)) {
		    countCharacters.put(c, 1);
		   } else {
		    countCharacters.put(c, countCharacters.get(c) + 1);
		   }
		  }
		  // As LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order, first character with
		  // count 1 should return first non repeated character
		  for (Entry<Character, Integer> e : countCharacters.entrySet()) {
		   if (e.getValue() == 1)
		    return Optional.of(e.getKey());
		 
		  }
		  return Optional.ofNullable(null);
		 
		 }
 
When above method returned Optional, you are already aware that it can return null value too.
You can call Optional’s isPresent method to check if there is any value wrapped in Optional.

Optional<Character> opCh=getNonRepeatedCharacterOpt("SASAS");
		if(opCh.isPresent())
			System.out.println("Non repeated character is :"+opCh.toString());
		else
		{
			System.out.println("No non repeated character found in String");
		}
 
If there is no value present in Optional, it will simply print “No non repeated character found in String”.

10) What are defaults methods?
Default method are those methods in interface which have body and use default keywords.Default method are introduced in Java 8 mainly because of backward compatibility.
You can refer to default method in java for more details.

11) What is the difference between Predicate and Function?
Both are functional interfaces.
Predicate<T> is single argument function and either it returns true or false.This can be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

Function<T,R> is also single argument function but it returns an Object.Here T denotes type of input to the function and R denotes type of Result.

This can also be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

12) Are you aware of Date and Time API introduced in Java 8? What the issues with Old Date and time API?
Issues with old Date and TIme API:

Thread Safety: You might be already aware that java.util.Date is mutable and not thread safe. Even java.text.SimpleDateFormat is also not Thread-Safe. New Java 8 date and time APIs are thread safe.

Performance: Java 8 ‘s new APIs are better in performance than old Java APIs.

More Readable: Old APIs such Calendar and Date are poorly designed and hard to understand. Java 8 Date and Time APIs are easy to understand and comply with ISO standards.

13) Can you provide some APIs of Java 8 Date and TIme?
LocalDate, LocalTime, and LocalDateTime are the Core API classes for Java 8. As the name suggests, these classes are local to context of observer. It denotes current date and time in context of Observer.

14) How will you get current date and time using Java 8 Date and TIme API?
You can simply use now method of LocalDate to get today’s date.

LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now();
System.out.println(currentDate);
 
It will give you output in below format:

2017-09-09
You can use now method of LocalTime to get current time.

LocalTime currentTime = LocalTime.now();
System.out.println(currentTime);
 
It will give you output in below format:

23:17:51.817
15) Do we have PermGen in Java 8? Are you aware of MetaSpace?
Until Java 7, JVM used an area called PermGen to store classes. It got removed in Java 8 and replaced by MetaSpace.
Major advantage of MetaSpace over permgen:
PermGen was fixed in term of mazimum size and can not grow dynamically but Metaspace can grow dynamically and do not have any size constraint.

Next 7 questions will be based on below class.

package org.arpit.java2blog;
 
public class Employee {
	private String name;
	private int age;
	
	public Employee(String name, int age) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	public int getAge() {
		return age;
	}
	public void setAge(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}
        public String toString()
	{
		return "Employee Name: "+name+" age: "+age;
	}
}
 

16) Given a list of employees, you need to filter all the employee whose age is greater than 20 and print the employee names.(Java 8 APIs only)
Answer:
You can simply do it using below statement.
 
List<String> employeeFilteredList = employeeList.stream()
		          .filter(e->e.getAge()>20)
		          .map(Employee::getName)
		          .collect(Collectors.toList());
 
Complete main program for above logic.

package org.arpit.java2blog;
 
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
 
public class MaximumUsingStreamMain {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
		List<String> employeeFilteredList = employeeList.stream()
		          .filter(e->e.getAge()>20)
		          .map(Employee::getName)
		          .collect(Collectors.toList());
		
		employeeFilteredList.forEach((name)-> System.out.println(name));
		
	}
	
	public static List<Employee> createEmployeeList()
	{
		List<Employee> employeeList=new ArrayList<>();
 
		Employee e1=new Employee("John",21);
		Employee e2=new Employee("Martin",19);
		Employee e3=new Employee("Mary",31);
		Employee e4=new Employee("Stephan",18);
		Employee e5=new Employee("Gary",26);
 
		employeeList.add(e1);
		employeeList.add(e2);
		employeeList.add(e3);
		employeeList.add(e4);
		employeeList.add(e5);
 
		return employeeList;
	}
}
 

17) Given the list of employees, count number of employees with age 25?
Answer:
You can use combination of filter and count to find this.


List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
long count = employeeList.stream()
.filter(e->e.getAge()>25)
.count();
System.out.println("Number of employees with age 25 are : "+count);
 

18) Given the list of employees, find the employee with name “Mary”.
Answer:
It is again very simple logic, change the main function in above class as following.


List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
		Optional<Employee> e1 = employeeList.stream()
		          .filter(e->e.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("Mary")).findAny();
		        
		if(e1.isPresent())
			System.out.println(e1.get());
 

19)Given a list of employee, find maximum age of employee?
Answer:
It is again very simple logic, change the main function in above class as following.


List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
		OptionalInt max = employeeList.stream().
				          mapToInt(Employee::getAge).max();
		        
		if(max.isPresent())
			System.out.println("Maximum age of Employee: "+max.getAsInt());
 

20) Given a list of employees, sort all the employee on the basis of age? Use java 8 APIs only
You can simply use sort method of list to sort the list of employees.

List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
		employeeList.sort((e1,e2)->e1.getAge()-e2.getAge());
		employeeList.forEach(System.out::println);
 

21) Join the all employee names with “,” using java 8?
Answer:

	List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
		List<String> employeeNames = employeeList
				                     .stream()
				                     .map(Employee::getName)
				                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
		String employeeNamesStr = String.join(",", employeeNames);
		System.out.println("Employees are: "+employeeNamesStr);
 
Output:

Employees are: John,Martin,Mary,Stephan,Gary

22) Given the list of employee, group them by employee name?
Answer:
You can use Collections.groupBy() to group list of employees by employee name.
 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
 
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
 
public class MaximumUsingStreamMain {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		List<Employee> employeeList = createEmployeeList();
		Map<String, List<Employee>> map = employeeList.stream()
				                              .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getName));
		map.forEach((name,employeeListTemp)->System.out.println("Name: "+name+" ==>"+employeeListTemp));
	}
	
	public static List<Employee> createEmployeeList()
	{
		List<Employee> employeeList=new ArrayList<>();
 
		Employee e1=new Employee("John",21);
		Employee e2=new Employee("Martin",19);
		Employee e3=new Employee("Mary",31);
		Employee e4=new Employee("Mary",18);
		Employee e5=new Employee("John",26);
 
		employeeList.add(e1);
		employeeList.add(e2);
		employeeList.add(e3);
		employeeList.add(e4);
		employeeList.add(e5);
 
		return employeeList;
	}
}
 
Output:

Name: John ==>[Employee Name: John age: 21, Employee Name: John age: 26]
Name: Martin ==>[Employee Name: Martin age: 19]
Name: Mary ==>[Employee Name: Mary age: 31, Employee Name: Mary age: 18]

23) Difference between Intermediate and terminal operations in Stream?
Answer:
Java 8 stream supports both intermediate and terminal operation.

Intermediate operations are lazy in nature and do not get executed immediately. Terminal operations are not lazy, they are executed as soon as encountered. Intermediate operation is memorized and is called when terminal operation is called.

All Intermediate operations return stream as it just transforms stream into another and terminal operation don’t.

Example of Intermediate operations are:

filter(Predicate)
map(Function)
flatmap(Function)
sorted(Comparator)
distinct()
limit(long n)
skip(long n)
Example of terminal operations are :

forEach
toArray
reduce
collect
min
max
count
anyMatch
allMatch
noneMatch
findFirst
findAny

24) Given the list of numbers, remove the duplicate elements from the list.
Answer:
You can simply use stream and then collect it to set using Collections.toSet() method.


package org.arpit.java2blog;
 
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
 
public class RemoveDuplicatesFromListMain {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Integer[] arr=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,3,2,4,2};
		List<Integer> listWithDuplicates = Arrays.asList(arr);
		
		Set<Integer> setWithoutDups = listWithDuplicates.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet());
		setWithoutDups.forEach((i)->System.out.print(" "+i));
	}
}
 
You can use distinct as well to avoid duplicates as following.
change main method of above program as below.

 
Integer[] arr=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,3,2,4,2};
		List<Integer> listWithDuplicates = Arrays.asList(arr);
List<Integer> listWithoutDups = listWithDuplicates.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
		listWithoutDups.forEach((i)->System.out.print(" "+i));
 

25) Difference between Stream’s findFirst() and findAny()?
findFirst will always return the first element from the stream whereas findAny is allowed to choose any element from the stream.
findFirst has deterministic behavior whereas findAny is nondeterministic behavior.


26) Given a list of numbers, square them and filter the numbers which are greater 10000 and then find average of them.( Java 8 APIs only)
Answer:
You can use the map function to square the number and then filter to avoid numbers which are less than 10000.We will use average as terminating function in this case.

 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
 
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.OptionalDouble;
 
public class RemoveDuplicatesFromListMain {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Integer[] arr=new Integer[]{100,24,13,44,114,200,40,112};
		List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(arr);
		OptionalDouble average = list.stream()
				                 .mapToInt(n->n*n)
				                 .filter(n->n>10000)
				                 .average();
		
		if(average.isPresent())
			System.out.println(average.getAsDouble());
		
	}
}
 
output:

21846.666666666668

27) What is use of Optional in Java 8?
Answer:
Java 8 optional can be used to avoid NullPointerException.You can read about the detailed tutorial.

Read Java 8 optional

28) What is predicate function interface?
Answer:
Predicate is single argument function which returns true or false. It has test method which returns boolean.
When we are using filter in above example, we are actually passing Predicate functional interface to it.

Read Java 8 predicate

29) What is consumer function interface?
Answer:
Consumer is single argument functional interface which does not return any value.
When we are using foreach in above example, we are actually passing Consumer functional interface to it.

Read Java 8 consumer

30) What is supplier function interface?
Answer:
Supplier is function interface which does not take any parameter but returns the value using get method.
